          <h4>I’ve always put a premium on leadership and problem-solving qualities 
            among my team members and Ariana never failed to deliver on both fronts.
          </h4> 
          <p> “Ariana is a great hire because she is a fantastic learner, 
            and is always so positive. In a circumstance one might be frustrated and give up, Ariana is the opposite. 
            She will always find something positive to reflect on, bringing the general mood up and puts a smile on our faces with her funny personality. 
            Being her mentor, I see exactly what a great asset and investment she'd be at any company. 
            She's constantly challenging herself and excelling.”</p>

          <p> “Ariana was a stand out student. She always took initiative in class, and was the 
            first one to turn in projects. In subjects she particularly excelled at, students would often 
            request that she tutor them. Ariana is an absolute treasure and role model, 
            I’d be happy to further discuss why she’d make a great asset to your company.”</p>

            as her skills working both autonomously and as a team is unmatched.
            She is one of the most disciplined and punctual person I’ve ever known. 
            Her ability to work efficiently under stressful and high-stake enviornments in her previous healthcare positions speaks volumes about her hard work, determination, and composed demeanor. <br><br>
            I could continue on with Ariana's many other amazing qualities- her work ethic, her high energy, humor, and her creative thinking to name four in addition. Instead
            I would simply like to say how much I think of Ariana and how strongly I reccommend her for any task that requires problem solving and creative responsibilities. ”

            In addition, She is always so motivated and interested in learning. To this end, she often accompanied our care 
            teams on their rounds so that she knew the status and needs of each individual patient. 
            Everyday Ariana showed high intelligent, superb analytical and communication skills. If her performance 
            in our company is a good indication of how she would perform in yours, she would be an extremely positive asset to your program.
